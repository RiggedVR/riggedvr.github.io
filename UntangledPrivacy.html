        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 21st December 2024<br />
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 30th June 2025</p>

        <p>We at Rigged Games (“Rigged Games,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and shared when you access and use our virtual reality game, <em>Untangled</em> (the "Game"), and any related services (collectively referred to as the "Services"). This policy specifically relates to <em>Untangled</em> and any associated game services, including logging in via PlayFab, interactions within the game, and the use of third-party features like the LIV Creator Kit (LCK).</p>

        <p>By using the Game and the Services, you agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <li><strong>Hardware ID:</strong> Collected during PlayFab login to tie gameplay data to your specific device, improving security and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>LIV Creator Kit (LCK) Data:</strong> If you use LCK features, information such as app and device metadata, usage trends, and diagnostic logs may be collected. This may include VR headset model, game version, general location (e.g., city), crash reports, and developer name.</li>
        </ul>
